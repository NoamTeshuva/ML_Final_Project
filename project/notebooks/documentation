📈 ML Project Documentation: Predicting Small-Cap Stock Movements
This document provides a comprehensive overview of a machine learning project aimed at predicting small-cap stock price movements. The project leverages various ML techniques—Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, PCA, and K-Means Clustering—to generate predictions based on historical data from Russell 2000 stocks.

1️⃣ Introduction
📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to predict next-day stock price movement of small-cap stocks using technical indicators derived from historical price data.

📌 Dataset
Source: Russell 2000 small-cap stocks
Features:
Technical Indicators: Moving Averages (SMA_50, SMA_200), RSI, MACD, Volatility
Historical price data: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
Preprocessing Steps:
Sorting by date to prevent data leakage
Handling missing values
Generating target labels (binary classification: stock up/down)
📌 Machine Learning Techniques Used
Decision Trees: For interpretable classification
Logistic Regression: For probability-based predictions
AdaBoost: To improve model performance with ensemble learning
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): For dimensionality reduction
K-Means Clustering: To uncover hidden patterns in stock movements
2️⃣ Issues Identified & Fixes Implemented
During the initial implementation, we identified six major issues that were fixed to improve model performance. The table below summarizes the problem, solution, and impact of each fix.

Issue	Problem	Fix Applied	Impact
1️⃣ Data Leakage (Target Shift Issue)	shift(-1) applied before sorting the dataset, causing incorrect labels.	Sorted dataset by date before shifting target variable.	✅ Prevents data leakage, ensuring correct chronological order.
2️⃣ Missing Feature Scaling	K-Means and PCA were applied without scaling, leading to biased results.	StandardScaler applied to normalize features.	✅ Equalizes feature influence, improving clustering and PCA performance.
3️⃣ Imbalanced Dataset	Some stocks had more up movements than down, biasing predictions.	SMOTE (Oversampling) applied to balance dataset.	✅ Improves model fairness and generalization.
4️⃣ Redundant Features (Multicollinearity)	Some features were highly correlated, causing overfitting.	PCA applied, keeping 95% variance.	✅ Reduces noise, improving robustness.
5️⃣ Suboptimal Hyperparameters	Default parameters used for Decision Trees and AdaBoost.	GridSearchCV used to fine-tune models.	✅ Improves predictive power and stability.
6️⃣ Improper Pipeline Order	K-Means applied before scaling & PCA, reducing cluster quality.	Reordered steps (Scaling → Balancing → PCA → K-Means).	✅ Improves clustering quality and interpretability.

📊 Key Insights
1️⃣ Model Performance
Model	Cross-Validation Accuracy (Average)	Final Accuracy on Test Set
Logistic Regression	~74.77%	74.49%
AdaBoost	~74.44%	74.83%

2️⃣ Warnings & Fixes
Issue	Warning Type	Solution
FutureWarning: Series.getitem treating keys as positions is deprecated	❌ Future issue with y_train_balanced[train_index]	✅ Fix: Use y_train_balanced.iloc[train_index]
ConvergenceWarning: Logistic Regression didn't converge	❌ Logistic Regression stopped before fully training	✅ Fix: Increase max_iter=1000
🔥 Fix These Issues in model_training.py
✅ 1. Fix FutureWarning (Series.__getitem__ treating keys as positions)
Modify the line in Time-Series Cross-Validation:

python
Copy
Edit
y_train_fold, y_test_fold = y_train_balanced.iloc[train_index], y_train_balanced.iloc[test_index]
✅ Why?

This prevents issues in future versions of Pandas.
✅ 2. Fix Logistic Regression Not Converging
Modify Logistic Regression training:

python
Copy
Edit
log_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000).fit(X_train_pca, y_train_balanced)
✅ Why?

This gives the model more time to train properly.
✅ 3. Fix K-Means Inertia Issue
Your K-Means Inertia value is too large, meaning:

Clusters may not be well-separated.
K=5 might not be the best choice.
Solution: Print More Cluster Insights
Modify the K-Means evaluation section:

python
Copy
Edit
print(f"✅ K-Means Inertia: {kmeans.inertia_:.2e}")  # Use scientific notation for readability
print(f"✅ K-Means Silhouette Score: {silhouette_score(X_train_kmeans, kmeans.labels_):.2f}")
print(f"✅ K-Means Cluster Centers:\n{kmeans.cluster_centers_[:5]}")  # Show only first 5 centers
✅ Why?

Easier to read inertia in scientific notation.
Shows cluster centers to analyze how stocks are grouped.
🚀 Next Steps
1️⃣ Apply these fixes in model_training.py.

✅ Key Observations:

Logistic Regression is performing well, achieving 74.47% accuracy on test data.
AdaBoost still struggles in cross-validation (~53-55%) but performs better on the test set (72.11%).
This suggests AdaBoost is still overfitting to the training set.
The gap between cross-validation and test accuracy needs to be reduced.
PCA Explained Variance Ratio is 99.30%, meaning minimal data loss.
K-Means Performance:
Inertia: 1.79e+06 → Indicates reasonable clustering compactness.
Silhouette Score: 0.43 → Shows fairly good cluster separation.
